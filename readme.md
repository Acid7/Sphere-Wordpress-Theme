This WordPress theme I made a couple of years ago..

![Sphere theme](https://github.com/Acid7/Sphere-Wordpress-Theme/blob/main/screenshot.png?raw=true)

(The build process was done with CodeKit, in folders with underscore are source files for .js and .stylus, which are build based on the CodeKit settings in config file)

Tested with WordPress 6.5.x
